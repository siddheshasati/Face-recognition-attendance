# FACE RECOGNITION ATTENDENCE

This project is a face recognition attendance system that utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize faces and track attendance. The system captures images of individuals, processes them using facial recognition algorithms, and logs attendance based on recognized faces.








## Deployment


 To deploy the face recognition project

 simply run an python file as [add_faces.py]  to recognized the face and to mark the name as data collection


 To deploy the face reference as face recognition operation, simply run an python program [test.py]   

 To deploy this project on web 
```bash
  streamlit run app.py

```
